## javascript code
### choice
I choose to use javascript without typescript to have a straight runnable code.
### How to run
Install nvm, volta or node 18.

Go into the folder that you want (example : `cd 2022/javascript/`)

Switch into node 18 (`nvm use` if you use nvm, and it happens magically if you are using volta)

You can now request to execute the day you want by running it straight or with yarn commands (day is mandatory for this choice)
```
yarn start [day you want] [optional file you want as entry]
```

```
node ./day1.js [optional file you want as entry]
```

## Rust code
### Choice
Rust will be the next langage I will do
